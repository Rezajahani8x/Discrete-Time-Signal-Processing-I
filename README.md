# Discrete-Time-Signal-Processing-I

This project involves different operations. It is based on discrete time signal processing. Furthermore, more applications are presented.

Section 1) Short Time Fourier Transform & Wavelet Transform


    * In this section short time fourier transform is implemented.
    * Employing Wavelet Transform to detect frequencies in different durations of a voice signal.
    
    
Section 2) DTMF Voice Detection


Section 3) Compressing Image via 2D Fourier Transform


Section 4) Brain Signal Analysis (EEG Signal Processing)


    * In this section EEG signals are obtained from brain and processed.
    * This processing is used to predict behaviour and mind state.
    
    
Section 5) Cepstrum
